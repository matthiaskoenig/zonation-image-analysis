### Delaunay triangulation
Close relationship between Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi diagram.

The Delaunay triangulation of a discrete point set in general position corresponds to the dual graph of the Voronoi diagram for P. The circumcenters of Delaunay triangles are the vertices of the Voronoi diagram.

For modelling terrain or other objects given a point cloud, the Delaunay triangulation gives a nice set of triangles to use as polygons in the model. 

Typically, the domain to be meshed is specified as a coarse simplicial complex; for the mesh to be numerically stable, it must be refined, for instance by using **Ruppert's algorithm**.

- **Delaunay refinement**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_refinement#Ruppert's_algorithm

- A subdivision S is a maximal planar subdivision such that adding one edge connecting two vertices of S destroys the planarity of S. What does destroying the planarity mean? Adding an edge intersects at least one existing edge. 

DeÔ¨Ånition (triangulation of a point set)
Let P be a set of points in the plane. A triangulation of the point set P is a maximal planar subdivision which has P as its vertex set.
