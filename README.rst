Zonation image analysis
=======================

This repository implements functionality for the image analysis based on whole-slide images (WSI) and large images either using brightfield or fluorescence microscopy. A key analysis is the analysis and quantification of zonation patterns from fluorscence images of the liver using double stainings with CYP2E1 and E-catharin.

Features include among others

- helper functions for reading and writing pyramidal formats (OME-TIF)
- tools for quantification of zonation patterns
- image processing helpers
